Seminar on Uptake of radionuclides into staple crops in the Asian region
Daejon, Korea, 16-17 April 2009
Summary: A seminar was organised to enhance capabilities of Member States located in the Asia-Pacific region to predict radionuclide transfer in the environment and, thereby, to assess exposure levels of the public and biota in order to ensure an appropriate level of protection from the effects of ionizing radiation, associated with radionuclide releases and from existing radionuclides in the environment. The seminar continued the IAEA activities on radioecological assessment and modelling that were aimed at refining information to be applied for assessing radionuclide transfer in the environment. The seminar has provided a good summary of the current radioecological research in the region and

identified existing gaps in radioecological research in the Asia-Pacific region. Based on this analysis some recommendations on further studies to be carried out in the region to increase robustness in environmental assessments in the Asia-Pacific region were proposed. The seminar recommended that more attention is be paid to retain experience in environmental assessment practice including creation of the network of the centres of excellence, organisation of training for young researchers in sampling, radioactivity analysis, data evaluation, transfer parameters evaluation, radioecological models and tools applications.
