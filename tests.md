# Proficiency Tests

​​IAEA proficiency tests and interlaboratory comparison exercises are organized on a regular basis specifically for the members of the ALMERA network. These exercises are designed to monitor and demonstrate the performance and analytical capabilities of the network members, and to identify gaps and problem areas where further development is needed. At least one exercise is organized per year by the IAEA for the ALMERA network. The sample set shipped to each participating laboratory consists of various environmental samples to be characterized for anthropogenic and natural alpha-, beta- and gamma-emitter radionuclides. It has to be noticed that participants can report their measurement results on radionuclides of their choice, it is not compulsory to report measurement results on all requested radionuclides. Evaluation of results will be carried out only on the measurement results reported by the participating laboratories.

A specificity of the ALMERA proficiency tests is the possibility given to the ALMERA members to report their results on gamma-emitting radionuclides in a very short time frame, i.e. 3 days, as this would be required for emergency response.

The IAEA proficiency tests and interlaboratory comparison exercises are listed in the table below:

In conclusion it is important to mention that in all organized proficiency tests it was evident that the ALMERA laboratories performance was better that the population of laboratories worldwide in terms of rapid responding and the accuracy of the results. The proficiency test results showed that further efforts should be invested in the development of standard and rapid methods to improve analytical performance of ALMERA network.

2007 ALMERA proficiency test on the determination of Po-210 in water
Summary: The Po-210 poisoning event which occurred in November 2006 brought into focus a number of issues, including the capacity of laboratories of ALMERA to rapidly and accurately determine Po-210 in environmental samples. A number of requests were received from ALMERA members to address this issue. Responding to these requests, this proficiency test on the determination of Po-210 in water was conducted in the frame of the ALMERA network. The aim was to gather information on the current state of practice for Po-210 measurements at various levels in aqueous samples.

The overall evaluation showed that 78% of all reported results fulfilled the proficiency test.

2005 ALMERA soil sampling interlaboratory comparison exercice
Summary: The soil sampling intercomparison exercise took place from 14 to 18 November 2005 in an agricultural area qualified as a ‘reference site’ in the frame of the SOILSAMP international project, funded and coordinated by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency (ISPRA) and aimed at assessing the uncertainty associated with soil sampling in agricultural, seminatural, urban and contaminated environments. The ‘reference site’ is characterised in terms of spatial/temporal variability of trace elements. The trace elements present at the reference site are of natural and anthropogenic origins. In the long term after deposition, the behaviour of long-lived radionuclides in soil can be expected to be similar to that of some stable trace elements and the distribution of these trace elements in soil can simulate the distribution of radionuclides. In addition, soil sampling procedures for radionuclides derive from techniques used in agriculture and engineering. For all these reasons, the ‘reference site’ characterized in term of trace elements can be used to compare the soil sampling strategies developed for radionuclide investigations by the ALMERA laboratories.

Due to the limited extent of the reference sampling area and considering that collaborative field studies require considerable organisational efforts, for the current year exercise only 10 ALMERA Institutions were selected to participate in the sampling exercise.
