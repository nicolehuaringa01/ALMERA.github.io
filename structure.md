Network Structure

The International Atomic Energy Agencyâ€™s Environment Laboratories are the central coordinator of the ALMERA network's activities.

To facilitate interactions between the ALMERA laboratories, the network is subdivided into the following regional groups:

- Africa
- Europe
- Middle East
- Asia Pacific
- North and Latin America

Each regional group is coordinated by an ALMERA regional coordinating centre. The current coordinating centres are:

- the Egyptian Nuclear And Radiological Regulatory Authority (ENRRA) for Africa,
- the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany for Europe;
- the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria (AECS) for Middle East.
- the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO, Australia) for the Asia-Pacific region, and,
- the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission for the North and Latin America region.
