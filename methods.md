# Validated Analytical Methods

Tested and validated analytical procedures are important tools for the production of reliable, comparable and ‘fit for purpose’ analytical measurements. However, finding and choosing a procedure can be a challenge due to a wide variety of technologies available and the rapidity of developments in the field.

Therefore, since 2004 the IAEA’s programme related to ALMERA has included activities aimed towards the development of a set of procedures for determination of radionuclides in environmental samples. It is intended that as these are developed, they will be made available to laboratories wishing to use procedures that have been validated by a large number of laboratories and therefore could be regarded as having been widely tested.

The following table reports the most recent outcomes of ALMERA’s activities aimed towards the development of a set of procedures for determination of radionuclides in environmental samples, both for routine environmental monitoring and emergency monitoring. The number between brackets is related to the corresponding IAEA publication available for download below the table.
